# Node Express Handlebars - Burger Logger
Created a burger logger with MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and a homemade ORM. Followed the MVC design pattern; using Node and MySQL to query and route data in my app, and Handlebars to generate my HTML. Users will be able to create a list of burgers they wish to eat. When they get the oppurtunity to devour that burger they can click the devour button in order to move it to the devoured list. If they wish to eat the burger again all they have to do is click the reorder button. They can also feel free to delete a burger whther it has been devoured or not from either list.
